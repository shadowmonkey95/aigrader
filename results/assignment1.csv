VuPham,assignment1,60,"The solution correctly identifies prime numbers in some cases, such as the test number 17, but contains a critical flaw in its algorithm. It fails to correctly classify even numbers greater than 2 as non-prime due to skipping the divisibility check by 2. This oversight significantly impacts the function's accuracy. The edge cases for numbers less than or equal to 1 are handled correctly, and the function structure is good, but the main logic error reduces its effectiveness. To improve, the function should first check if the number is even (and not equal to 2) before proceeding with the loop for odd divisors.",2025-04-17 00:25:28
LeeYoung,assignment1,100,"The solution is correct and efficiently checks for prime numbers. It handles edge cases properly, such as numbers less than or equal to 1, and numbers 2 and 3. The use of the 6kÂ±1 optimization for checking divisibility is a smart approach that reduces the number of checks needed, making the function more efficient. The test case provided in the main function correctly demonstrates the function's ability to identify a prime number. Overall, this is an excellent solution.",2025-04-17 00:27:46
