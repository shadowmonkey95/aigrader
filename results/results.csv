VuPham,assignment1,70,"The student's solution correctly identifies prime numbers in some cases, such as the test case provided (17), and handles edge cases like numbers less than or equal to 1 correctly. However, the solution contains a critical bug in the prime checking algorithm: it fails to correctly classify even numbers greater than 2 as non-prime. This is because the algorithm only checks divisibility starting from 3 and increments by 2, skipping even divisors entirely. A correct solution should first check if the number is even (and greater than 2) before proceeding with the loop. The student's approach is on the right track but misses an important check, hence the grade reflects a partial understanding of the problem."
