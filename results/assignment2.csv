VuPham,assignment2,70,"The student's solution correctly identifies prime numbers in some cases, such as the test case provided (17), and handles edge cases like numbers less than or equal to 1 correctly. However, the solution contains a critical bug in the prime checking algorithm: it fails to correctly classify even numbers greater than 2 as non-prime. This oversight significantly impacts the function's accuracy for a subset of inputs. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the problem and edge cases but needs to revise the algorithm to handle all cases correctly.",2025-07-23 19:15:45
